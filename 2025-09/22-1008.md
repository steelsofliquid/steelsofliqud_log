## This log
I'm opting to change the entries to day and time in hour and minute, 24-hour.


## OpenSteel/OS
I've opted to set up a makeshift roadmap for the overhauls I want to make. Instead of fretting over having multiple things, focus purely on one, divide and conquer (except it's all by myself). I'll make what I call a "block": A phase in the project, which will have its own codename (cities in North America will be the style): This one will be Denver, named after the city in Colorado, USA. 0.22.42 will focus on the PIT stuff (which is semi-intertwined with the multitasking stuff), 0.22.44 will focus on the text mode adjustments with the cursor, 0.22.45 will focus on the CMOS driver and 0.22.46 will focus on anything else.

I'll have to scrap the testing of libstr and libmem for now, and I won't be able to fix those "executables", as I should probably implement a userland first. I also have to shelf the idea of implementing paging, as it may need a disk driver that I have not yet written. I presume it'll also be some trial and error getting that disk driver to work with most hard drives.


Anyways, that's all for now.
