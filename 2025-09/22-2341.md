# 2025 September 22, 23:41. Closing out the day...
Overall, it was fairly decent, I guess. Zoned out a few times and procrastinated by working on my own projects. Also made a winter outfit for Neisa, which is unrelated, so that's an additional side-quest bonus!

## OpenSteel/OS
So, I focused a lot on my PIT driver and the multitasking system. Main sleep function will now incorporate the task manager, and a new function will be "written" *(more like copied back from 0.22.41)* called HardSleep, which will be a hardware busy-wait sleeping thing for quick jobs and whatnot. Also, the default PIT interval will be 100 Hz instead of 1000 Hz. I'll immediately need to implement HardSleep into some other components, most prominently the speaker driver.

## Other things
I made this repo and updated some other repos to include a link to this repo. IDK what else to put here -_-

Well, I guess I WOULD like to make this repo look a bit nicer, particularly with some Neisa images, but that's for another day, and it's now almost midnight. I should get to my just-before-bedtime reading of Linus Torvalds' autobiography soon...

___
Overall, that's it. I'd say it's a fairly productive day on the OpenSteel/OS front, but not on anything else. I think build 42 will soon be ready, but can't be 100% sure. I also now want both a DVD player and a Blu-Ray player, but that's unrelated.
