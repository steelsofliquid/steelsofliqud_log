I feel like I'm focusing too much on too many things at once: Adding better memory management, a terminal emulator of sorts, controlling the text mode cursor, a CMOS driver, and improving the PIT driver. So, I'll just focus on each thing one-by-one: I'll start with the PIT driver, and then the CMOS driver. This is only the surface of what I want to add, but whatever...
