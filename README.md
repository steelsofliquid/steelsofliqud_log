# steelsofliqud_log
This repo is a general log of things I want to implement in my other repos and whatnot. A public "diary" to a degree, something you can check out that is my thoughts and perspectives of my own projects as they are in development. This may include OpenSteel/OS, Serotonin, my miniprojects/sidequests repo, and more.

## Why make this?
Because it should be clear as to what I am thinking of my own projects and their progress. It may include a roadmap of sorts, status of the next build, and more.
