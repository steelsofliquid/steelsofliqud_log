# steelsofliqud_log
This repo is a general log of things I want to implement in my other repos and whatnot. A public "diary" to a degree, something you can check out that is my thoughts and perspectives of my own projects as they are in development. This may include OpenSteel/OS, Serotonin, my miniprojects/sidequests repo, and more.

## Why make this?
Because it should be clear as to what I am thinking of my own projects and their progress. It may include a roadmap of sorts, status of the next build, and more.

## Why is it rarely active a lot more these days?
You see, I did a lot of my logging while using GitHub on school grounds to provide an extra layer of thinking and journalling to my life. Unfortunately, the school district I go to (as of November 2025) is not very friendly to open source repository sites (like GitHub and SourceForge), and they blocked GitHub (which I think is extremely stupid). But behold, the workaround, just write my thoughts offline, like what I do for OpenSteel/OS code. I apologise for not being more active here T_T
