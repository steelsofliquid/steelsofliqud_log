## New projects

I'm thinking of ideas for a potential office suite designed for OpenSteel/OS, Linux and Windows (Apple and Google won't get money out of me if it's related to software development). I want to consider this, as if OpenSteel/OS becomes a big deal (it probably won't, but that shouldn't mean putting good quality effort into it), and Microsoft doesn't want to cooperate regarding their software, well…

I also generally have an interest in computer program development, so that'd be nice for me.

## OpenSteel/OS

So, I'm going to release the 0.22.64 code soon, as my next objective is to split up the interrupts code. Also, I'd argue that I should invoke `\a` before anything is displayed, as many pieces of hardware don't reset the screen buffer, especially old ones.

Anyways, that's all for now.
