This is a brief entry. Today was quite a successful day. I resolved the conflict between the keyboard driver, shell and kernel, and so I can move on to other things. I've felt this feeling of my body virtually bulging outward. I don't know why. It's hard to explain. It feels *hard* to explain a lot of the things about my body, and my thoughts. I digress. But, I'm tired, and so, a day well done. ^_^
