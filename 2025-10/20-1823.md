# Resuming OpenSteel/OS development... slowly.

I'm going to be slowly resuming development on OpenSteel/OS 0.22 "Hakurei" (currently in the Denver block). I have a bit of a formal roadmap, and I'm lightening the load on school assignments by getting enough to be good, but not perfect. I want to orient the project as a form of stable and robust middle ground between Windows and Linux, but I don't think it'll ever topple either. Nadella and Torvalds will be delighted, although the only thing I could complain about with Linux is its heavily fragmented distributon. And I actually admire Torvalds a bit, so...

In all seriousness, I've made a provisional community waifu (similar to Neisa Sapphira-Aera's status in the SteelsOfLiquid community), updated the bootscreen design, and started making a bit of an effort to debug the PIT driver, which I've tried and it still doesn't work, and so I'm trying to see if I can fix other bits to make it work. Specifically the interrupt manager. I'll be experimenting with some code aspects I'm not 100% sure will work (but when is anything other than Hello World going to be 100% going to work without bugs or an error or something) and finding a very rudimentary way to debug both things.

That's honestly all I have for now.
