# 2025 October 2, 12:20. New month!
So, I don't have much to kick off the new month, but here's some stuff anyways...

## OpenSteel/OS
So, I have been slowly debugging this, as my initial build of what was supposed to be 0.22.44 was broken. I went through 0.22.44 and 0.22.45 and used multiple letters to denote builds, and so I'm allowing my test ISOs to be overwritten under the default filename, and I'm using the interim version 0.22denv (referencing the "Denver" block). As it turns out, what I'm focusing on, the PIT driver, is very much incomplete and to a degree, *incompetent*. The PIT device is supposed to have a control word, according to multiple pieces of documentation, and mine does not. It also doesn't handle EoIs correctly if I had to guess, by the fact that the breaking thing is that all of the interrupts and drivers will not communicate at all if the PIT driver's functions are invoked in even the tiniest way. So, my plans are being [ antonym of accelerated which while used correctly here is also a slur ] for now, especially due to school things. So, it's in the works.

I'm also thinking of what the eventual GUI will look like and how it'll be implemented.

And that's it. Not much.
